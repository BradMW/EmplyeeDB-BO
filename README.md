 ## Installation
  You must first set up a SQL connection by running mysql -u root -p in the intergrated terminal. Then you will want to SOURCE the schema and then the seeds.sql files. After your db is set up you can run node server.js in the terminal and view the information from there.

 ## Usage
  You can use this project to view a database of employees and track the different departments and roles. If you need to add a new department or a new employee this app gives you that functionality. You can also update an existing employees role.
